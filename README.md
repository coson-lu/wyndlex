- :wave: Hi, I‚Äôm @wyndlex!

- :eyes: I am a person who enjoys doing a large variety of activities. Here are some of them:
  - One of my many intrests is coding. I know a couple of different languages and always learning more! I am fluent in Python, p5.js and html css javascript. I have learned the basics of SQL, C, and Java.
  - I also love to read. My favorite author is hands down Brandon Sanderson. I have read countless books by him. Whether it's the Reckoner's Series, Stormlight Archive, Mistborn, or any other book he's written, it's amazing. I am currently reading the Skyward series, also by him. It is also (not suprisingly) an amazing piece of work by him.
  - I also like to play sports. I'm in a soccer league, representing Castro Valley. Playing badminton is also super enjoyable. Basketball, too, is a blast!
  - I used to own 12 fish, but they all died. Actually, coincidentally, I got a new pet today. More like 10 of them. My mom came back today with 2 boxes full of butterfly's in thier cocoon. I'm sooo excited to raise them.

- :seedling: I‚Äôm currently learning CS50 course. That course teaches you some 6 different languages, including SQL, C, Python, and even Scratch! The course is free, and is a very effective learning tool if you want to learn some new languages.

- üíûÔ∏è I'm not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment...But stay tooned for the future!

- :mailbox: How to reach me: You can't
