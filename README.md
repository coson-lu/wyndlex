- :wave: Hi, I‚Äôm @wyndlex!

- :eyes: I am a person who enjoys doing a large variety of activities. Here are some of them:
  - One of my many intrests is coding. I know a couple of different languages and always learning more! I am fluent in Python, p5.js and html css javascript. I have learned the basics of SQL, C, and Java.
  - I also love to read. My favorite author is hands down Brandon Sanderson. I have read countless books by him. Whether it's the Reckoner's Series, Stormlight Archive, Mistborn, or any other book he's written, it's amazing. I'm reading the twilight saga right now (on the third book).
  - I also like to play sports. I'm in a soccer league, representing Rocklin. Playing badminton is also super enjoyable. Basketball, too, is a blast!

- :seedling: I learning

- üíûÔ∏è I'm not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment...But stay tooned for the future!

- :mailbox: How to reach me: You can't
